    "text": "Arjun Krishna  I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania advised by Prof.Â Dinesh Jayaraman. My research interests broadly lie in area of robot learning, with specific interests in understanding the nature of information flow in perception-action loops and developing resource-efficient agents. I previously obtained my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I had the privileged of being advised by Prof.Â Matthew Gombolay. I received my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at IIT Madras, and was introduced to reinforcement learning research there by Prof.Â Balaraman Ravindran. Before returning to academia, I spent a few years as a Software Engineer at Indeed Japan, working on recommendation systems and advertisement bidding.\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n    \n        \n
