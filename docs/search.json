    "text": "Arjun Krishna  I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania advised by Prof.Â Dinesh Jayaraman. I am broadly interested in the field of Robot Learning.  I received my Masterâ€™s degree from Georgia Tech where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof.Â Matthew Gombolay. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in CS from IIT Madras and was introduced to RL research there by Prof.Â Balaraman Ravindran. I also worked as a Software Engineer in the space of RecSys and Advertisement Bidding at Indeed Japan for about 3 years before returning to academia.\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n    \n        \n
