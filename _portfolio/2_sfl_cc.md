_Abstract_:
A lot of everyday problems like navigation come with long-horizon goal reaching tasks and solving them is crucial for building autonomous agents. However, traditional pure learning based approaches find achieving good success rates on long-horizon goal reaching tasks quite challenging. To address this problem prior methods have generally coupled learning based approaches with graph-based planning for waypoint selection. While most approaches assume pre-existing sufficient exploration strategies, one recent work titled Successor Feature Landmarks~(SFL) elaborates an exploration procedure along with graph construction mechanism to use for planning. However, the design of SFL is limited to only discrete and enumerable action spaces. In this work we present an adaptation of the SFL paradigm for continuous action spaces and demonstrate its effectiveness over purely learning based approaches on long-horizon goal reaching tasks in a point-control environment.
