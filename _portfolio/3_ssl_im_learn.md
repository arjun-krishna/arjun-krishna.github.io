_Abstract_:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms on high-dimensional inputs such as
raw pixels are often sample inefficient. Recent studies have shown benefits in
applying unsupervised or self-supervised learning approaches in learning rich
representations for training RL algorithms making them more sample efficient and
robust. In this report, we evaluate a few popular unsupervised learning approaches
in the context of visual navigation and measure the effectiveness in terms of sample
efficiency and robustness in a behavior cloning setting. Code and demonstration
dataset are available [here](https://github.com/arjun-krishna/irl-project)
