Developed UI to explore various numerical integrators of 2D vector fields with point animations, the UI was built with PyGame with backend algorithms in Numpy and uses python `eval` to parse vector field function input. More details available at the project README [[code]](https://github.com/arjun-krishna/vector-field-integrators)
