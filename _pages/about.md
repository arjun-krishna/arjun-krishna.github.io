I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am part of the Perception, Action, & Learning group at Penn.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated with an MSCS from georgia tech with a specialization in computational perception and robotics. I was part of the CORE robotics lab at Tech where I worked on agile robotics by building robots that play table tennis and tennis (see [project ESTHER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUktbRLfQw)). I also worked as a Software Engineer at Indeed Japan in algorithmic advertisement bidding and recommendation systems for about 3 years. For my undergrad, I was at IIT Madras and graduated with a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & Engineering in 2018 and I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.
