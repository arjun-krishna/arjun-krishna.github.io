I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am part of the [Perception, Action, & Learning Group](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/research-groups/perception-action-learning-group/) at Penn. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning and robotics.

Before pursuing my PhD, I obtained a Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, specializing in computational perception and robotics. At Tech, I was a member of the CORE Robotics Lab under the guidance of Prof. Matthew Gombolay and focused my efforts on building controllers for agile robotic systems that played table tennis and tennis (see [project ESTHER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUktbRLfQw)).

Prior to my experience at Georgia Tech, I spent approximately three years as a Software Engineer at Indeed (Tokyo, Japan) and worked primarily on large-scale recommendation systems and advertisement bidding. I received my B.Tech in CS from IIT Madras, were I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.
