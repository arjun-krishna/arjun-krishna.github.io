I am a Masters (MSCS) student at Georgia Tech specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I am broadly interested in the field of robot learning with specific interests in leveraging reinforcement learning and learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigms to acquire motor skills to solve complex manipulation tasks. 

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at CORE Robotics (advised by Prof. Matthew Gombolay) where we are building systems that can perform agile movements for sports and better co-ordinate & team-up with humans. My current research revolves around investigating how behavior primitives learned from demonstrations can be leveraged to bootstrap learning robust policies that are more adaptable to out-of-distribution (demonstrations) conditioning.

Prior to starting my Masters I worked as a Software Engineer at Indeed Japan K.K. in the space of advertisement bidding and recommendation systems. I graduated with B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & Engineering from IIT Madras in 2018, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.
