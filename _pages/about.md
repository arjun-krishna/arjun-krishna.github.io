I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am part of the [Perception, Action, & Learning Group](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/research-groups/perception-action-learning-group/) at Penn.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech with a specialization in computational perception and robotics. At Tech, I was part of the CORE Robotics Lab (PI: Prof. Matthew Gombolay) where I worked on agile robotics and built robotic systems that play table tennis and tennis (see [project ESTHER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUktbRLfQw)). Prior to my time at Tech, I worked as a Software Engineer at Indeed Japan in the space of algorithmic advertisement bidding and recommendation systems for about 3 years. For my undergrad, I was at IIT Madras and graduated with a B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & Engineering in 2018 and I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.
