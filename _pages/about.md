I am a Masters (MSCS) student at Georgia Tech specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I am broadly interested in the field of robot learning with specific interests in leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigms to acquire motor skills to solve complex manipulation tasks. 

I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant at <a href="https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/">CORE Robotics</a> (advised by Prof. Matthew Gombolay) where we are building systems that can perform agile movements for sports and better co-ordinate & team-up with humans. My current research revolves around the topic of how behavior primitives learned from demonstrations can be leveraged to bootstrap the process of learning robust striking policies that are more adaptable and have controllable outcomes, to this end I am exploring deployment of residual RL policies to improve the LfD based controllers in a sample-efficient manner.

Prior to starting my Masters I worked as a Software Engineer at Indeed Japan K.K. in the space of advertisement bidding and recommendation systems. I graduated with B.Tech (Hons) in Computer Science & Engineering from IIT Madras in 2018, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.
