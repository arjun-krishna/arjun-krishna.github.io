[Arjun Krishna]{.subtitle} <br/>
I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). I am broadly interested in the field of Robot Learning. <br style="margin-bottom: 10px"/>
I received my Master's degree from Georgia Tech where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://sites.gatech.edu/matthew-gombolay/). I obtained my bachelor's degree in CS from IIT Madras and was introduced to RL research there by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I also worked as a Software Engineer in the space of RecSys and Advertisement Bidding at Indeed Japan for about 3 years before returning to academia.
