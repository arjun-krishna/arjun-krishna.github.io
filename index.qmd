[Arjun Krishna]{.subtitle}
<br/>
I am a CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania advised by [Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). My research interests broadly lie in area of robot learning, with specific interests in understanding the nature of information flow in perception-action loops and developing resource-efficient agents.<br/><br/>
I previously obtained my Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I had the privileged of being advised by [Prof. Matthew Gombolay](https://sites.gatech.edu/matthew-gombolay/). I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science at IIT Madras, and was introduced to reinforcement learning research there by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). Before returning to academia, I spent a few years as a Software Engineer at Indeed Japan, working on recommendation systems and advertisement bidding.
