## The promise of model-based RL

- Model-free Deep RL requires a lot of trials-and-errors to learn!
    - As a consequence it applicability is limited to scenarios with a simulator

::: {.notes}
- But real-world is often hard to capture accurately and the learning algorithm but be adaptable to changing worlds!
